# DOCKER FLASK

Simple flask app for my article on Dockerizing a flask application.

## SETUP

### with Docker

### without Docker

Ensure you have the following on your PC:

```
- Python 3
- Pipenv
- Virtualenv (or virtualenvwrapper)
```

- Install the dependencies with the command

```pipenv install```

this command should be called from the root of the project.

- Start the application with the command

```python main.py```

P.S: Ensure you're running it in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
